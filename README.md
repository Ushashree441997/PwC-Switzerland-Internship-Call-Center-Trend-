Problem Statement :
In this project Create a dashboard in Power BI for the call center manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

# Possible KPIs include (but not limited to):
Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

Data Preparation:
Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:
Removed Unnecessary columns
Removed Unnecessary rows
Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type

Data Modeling:
And then dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to the data modeled.

Data Analysis (DAX):
Measures used in all visualization are:
Average of seed of answerd = AVERAGE('call centre trends'[Speed of answer in seconds])

Average of statisfaction = AVERAGE('call centre trends'[Satisfaction rating])

Count satisfation rating = COUNT('call centre trends'[Satisfaction rating])

Overall Customer Satisfation = DIVIDE([Possitive satisfation rating],[Count satisfation rating],0)

Possitive satisfation rating = CALCULATE(COUNT('call centre trends'[Satisfaction rating]),FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Satisfaction rating] IN {4,5}))

resolved calls = COUNTX(FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Resolved] = "Yes"), 'call centre trends'[Resolved])

Unresolved calls = COUNTX(FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Resolved] = "No"), 'call centre trends'[Resolved])

total calls = CALCULATE('Table'[total calls answered] + 'Table'[total calls unanswred])

total calls answered = COUNTX(FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Answered (Y/N)] = "Yes"),'call centre trends'[Answered (Y/N)])

total calls unanswred =COUNTX(FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Answered (Y/N)] = "No"), 'call centre trends'[Answered (Y/N)])

Insights :
Most of the satisfaction ratings from each call are 3 and 4.

The average satisfaction rating has decreased over the span of three months. January brought the highest satisfaction rating and march the lowest.

The percentage of issue resolved in January was the highest, with a dip in February. It increased again in march.

The majority of calls come in the morning.

The call resolution rate of Jim is the highest, even though the average speed of his answers is lower compared to those of Joe, Martha and Dan. The call answered by - him are also higher than the average number of calls answered.
